            <p class="push">A simple discord bot that posts Le Toucan (and other ASCII art images) in a
                specific channel called "toucan". This is hardcoded in the text, but it wouldn't be hard to
                change it to another channel name (why would you want to do that though??). Configured to run on
                replit by default, but works on pretty much anything. It's also pretty simple to edit the buttons:
                just replace the relevant ASCII art variable in toucan.py and update the associated button label and
                you're good to go!
            </p>
            <h2 id="Features">Features</h2>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Three (THREE!) buttons with their own ASCII art.</li>
                <li>Automatic deployment on all linked servers when the bot starts. That's right, it runs on multiple servers at once!</li>
                <li>If the toucan is praised (some variation of "praise him") in the toucan channel, the bot replies.</li>
                <li>All other messages posted in the toucan channel are deleted instantly.</li>
                <li>The bot also DMs the user in question and tells them to only praise le toucan (except if they're the bot's owner).</li>
                <li>To avoid clutter, all messages from the bot are deleted after 5 seconds.</li>
                <li>The ability to refresh the bot if things go wrong (not very often, hopefully).</li>
                <li>Want to run it on Replit? Just copy the files across and enter the bot token (easy!).</li>

            <ol type="1" class="list">
                <li>Ensure you have a channel called "toucan" (all lower case) on the server in question.</li>
                <li>Create a discord bot on the developer portal. <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started">instructions on making a bot can be found here.</a></li>
                <li>Get the bot token, invite the bot to the server with the "Send Messages" and "Manage Messages" bot permissions enabled.</li>
                <li>Open Replit, log in, and create a new Repl ("+" in the top right of the page).</li>
                <li>Select "import from github" and paste "github.com/Samsquamptch/LeToucan" into "GitHub URL".</li>
                <li>Once the Repl has been set up, open "Secrets" and create a new secret key with "TOKEN" as the key and the bot token as the value</li>
                <li>Press run at the top of the page and, after dependencies are installed, you now have Le Toucan Bot running!</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Please note that in order to run the bot continuously on Replit without deploying,
                you'll have to take further steps with a keepalive function. Instructions on how to
                add this to a bot can be found through a quick google search and aren't very complex.
                You can do it, I believe in you!

            <h2 id="Other">Other Projects</h2>
            <p>The primary purpose for making this bot was to learn how buttons worked in the Discord.py API.
                The information I learned from this project has been put to great use with my contribution to
                the doghouse inhouse bot. Not only have I been able to use buttons, but I've also learned how
                to implement Modals, Select menus, and embeds as well. If you're in need of a Dota 2 inhouse bot
                for your Discord server, then please check out the <a href="https://github.com/Teky500/doghouse">
                doghouse inhouse bot repo on Github</a> (still currently a work in progress).</p>
            <p>This page was made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which I will be using in future Github projects.
                Please check back here in the future for links to new projects I've created.
